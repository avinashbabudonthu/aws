# Introduction to AWS services
## AWS Global Data Centers
* `AWS Region`: Whenever we are using AWS services typically we deploy our application in AWS geographical area. That geographical area is called `AWS Regions`
* Across world there are different AWS regions available
* When we deploy services, we can choose which regions we need to deploy
* `Data Centers`: Every region contains - 2 or more data centers for high availability of AWS services. 
* `Availability Zones`: Data centers are called availability zones
* `Edge Locations`: Used for caching. Our content like media, videos, pictures are cached in the nearest AWS data center locations and delivered to users. It improves performance by lowering the latency
* AWS have `130+ services` like EC2, S3 etc
